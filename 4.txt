Abstract: This letter presents a simple methodology to quickly obtain the saddle-node bifurcation points of power systems by first solving a sequence of power flows that ends in the infeasible region and then performing a parabolic adjustment with the results of two infeasible cases. The proposed method exploits the ability of the factored load flow procedure to converge to complex solutions well beyond the maximum loading point. Test results on benchmark cases show that the new method yields a significant reduction in the computational cost, when compared to the previous approach based on exhaustive bisection search.

Abstract: This letter is focused on the issue of power imbalance caused by significant fluctuations of photovoltaic (PV) generation in a stand-alone microgrid. To exploit the flexibility of microgrid in addressing such issue, a novel rolling optimization based dispatch strategy involving a microgrid flexibility check model and a PV ramp scenario generation model is proposed. Based on the proposed strategy, the optimal operation schedule for conventional generation and energy storage system can be efficiently found. Case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: Electromechanical wave propagation is present in power systems as a transient spatial delay of generator rotor angle variations when a disturbance occurs. The control and mitigation of the this wave phenomenon, which spreads out to different locations at a comparably slow speed, is important for enhancing power system transient stability, as shown in part two of this two-paper series. In an idealized power system consisting of infinitesimal generators and line impedances, this traveling wave can exist to infinite frequencies, its speed can be derived from a wave equation and its reflection can be eliminated by a characteristic termination. Part one of this paper series examines realistic power systems with finite size generators and line impedances. It shows that there is a finite approximation of the traveling wave in real power systems as the wave can exist only within a finite frequency range. This paper also examines aspects such as reflections due to discrete elements, controller design based on the load modulation effect, and the existence of traveling wave and its attenuation in the Australian power system.

Abstract: This second part of a two-paper series gives an overview of key insights and control implications arising from the wave characteristics of power system transient stability. These insights, which are unique to traveling wave interpretation, are obtained through time-domain analysis of artificial and real test systems: "critical region for a stressed link near the end of a longitudinal system," "dispersed control in a path," "placement of controllers considering structure and load distribution in a system," and "localized transient stability enhancement." Good transient stability enhancement is successfully achieved by controllers in all test systems in terms of larger critical clearing time, which directly translates to increased maximum safe power transfer. The controller design is based on the transmission line analogy of traveling waves and load modulation effect. The concepts in this paper series can assist in improving the design of control strategies to enhance power system transient stability by considering the wave aspects.

Abstract: An adaptive control scheme based on the convexity property of polytopes for damping interarea oscillations is developed here. A polytopic control guarantees requisite damping when the current operating point lies inside it. Multiple polytopes increase the robustness of the control provided the polytope inside which the operating point lies after a disturbance is correctly identified. In this paper, the identification of the correct polytope is performed using Kalman-filters and the mean-chi square variable. A 29-machine 127-busmodel of theWestern Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system is used as the test system for this analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control is able to provide adequate damping to the interarea modes of oscillation under changing operating conditions without any prior knowledge of the postdisturbance operating state. It is also found to be more robust than some of the modern controllers proposed previously.

Abstract: This paper proposes mathematical models for sequential coordination of transmission expansion planning with strategic generation investments. The proactive and reactive coordinations are modeled and studied. The interaction between transmission company (Transco) and strategic generation companies (Gencos) is modeled using the sequential-move game. This is while the interaction between the strategic Gencos is modeled as a simultaneous-move game. In the proactive coordination, the Transco expands its future transmission capacities taking into account the strategic investments by Gencos. In the reactive coordination, strategic Gencos move first and expand their future generation capacities and then Transco expands the transmission capacity. The proactive coordination is modeled as a mixed-integer bilevel linear program (MIBLP) and the reactive coordination is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The MIBLP has binary variables in both upper and lower levels. The Moore-Bard algorithm is parallelized and used to solve the MIBLP. The mathematical models and the parallelized Moore-Bard algorithm are tested on 3-bus and 6-bus example systems and the modified IEEE-RTS96. Also, the IEEE 118-bus test system is studied using a heuristic version of the Moore-Bard algorithm.

Abstract: Stochastic economic dispatch models address uncertainties in forecasts of renewable generation output by considering a finite number of realizations drawn from a stochastic process model, typically via Monte Carlo sampling. Accurate evaluations of expectations or higher order moments for quantities of interest, e.g., generating cost, can require a prohibitively large number of samples. We propose an alternative to Monte Carlo sampling based on polynomial chaos expansions. These representations enable efficient and accurate propagation of uncertainties in model parameters, using sparse quadrature methods. We also use Karhunen-Lo` eve expansions for efficient representation of uncertain renewable energy generation that follows geographical and temporal correlations derived from historical data at each wind farm. Considering expected production cost, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield several orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost for solving stochastic economic dispatch relative toMonte Carlo sampling, for a given target error threshold.

Abstract: With the rapidly increasing penetration of wind power, wind producers are becoming increasingly responsible for the deviation of the wind power output from the forecast. Such uncertainty results in revenue losses to the wind power producers (WPPs) due to penalties in ex-post imbalance settlements. This paper explores the opportunities available for WPPs if they can purchase or schedule some reserves to offset part of their deviation rather than being fully penalized in the real-time market. The revenue forWPPs under such mechanism is modeled. The optimal strategy for managing the uncertainty of wind power by purchasing reserves tomaximize the WPP's revenue is analytically derived with rigorous optimality conditions. The amount of energy and reserves that should be bid in the market is explicitly quantified by the probabilistic forecast and the prices of the energy and reserves. A case study using the price data from ERCOT and wind power data from NREL is performed to verify the effectiveness of the derived optimal bidding strategy and the benefits of reserve purchasing. Additionally, the proposed bidding strategy can also reduce the risk of variations on WPP's revenue.

Abstract: Common Information Model (CIM) is widely adopted by many utilities since it offers interoperability through standard information models. Storing, processing, retrieving, and providing concurrent access of the large power network models to the various power system applications in CIM framework are the current challenges faced by utility operators. As the power network models resemble largely connected-data sets, the design of CIM oriented database has to support high-speed data retrieval of the connected-data and efficient storage for processing. The graph database is gaining wide acceptance for storing and processing of largely connected-data for various applications. This paper presents a design of CIM oriented graph database (CIMGDB) for storing and processing the largely connected-data of power system applications. Three significant advantages of the CIMGDB are efficient data retrieval and storage, agility to adapt dynamic changes in CIM profile, and greater flexibility of modeling CIM unified modeling language (UML) in GDB. The CIMGDB does not need a predefined database schema. Therefore, the CIM semantics needs to be added to the artifacts of GDB for every instance of CIM objects storage. A CIM based object-graph mapping methodology is proposed to automate the process. An integration of CIMGDB and power system applications is discussed by an implementation architecture. The data-intensive network topology processing (NTP) is implemented, and demonstrated for six IEEE test networks and one practical 400 kV Maharashtra network. Results such as computation time of executing network topology processing evaluate the performance of the CIMGDB.

Abstract: With high renewable power penetration, uncertainty and intermittence of renewable sources become major concerns of power system planning and operation. Large and fast wind speed change may cause great variation of active power generation, which may lead to system stability and reliability problems. The response speeds of the committed conventional generators (CGs) for frequency regulations are critical for system reliable and stable operation. The slowresponse of the committedCGs may result in power shortage or surplus, which may affect system frequency. This paper proposes a technique to evaluate operational reliability and efficiency problems of power systems with high wind power penetration from frequency aspect. Energy unnecessarily consumed and less supplied during system frequency control processes are modeled in detail. The reliability and economic indexes are formulated with considering system dynamic frequency control processes. The IEEE-RTS79 is used to verify the proposed models and method.

Abstract: Emergency control is an important measure for prevention of power system blackouts. This paper presents a new event-driven emergency load-shedding scheme that minimizes load shedding while meeting constraints on transient angle stability, voltage/frequency deviation security, and availability of load to be shed at any bus. The evaluation of these constraints is based on time domain trajectories provided by numerical simulations. The optimal event-driven load-shedding (OEDLS) model was created to minimize the total load-shedding cost. By analyzing the characteristics of the optimal solution of this model, a trajectory sensitivity based solution approach is presented. It linearizes the nonlinear OEDLS model through trajectory sensitivity and iteratively converges to the optimal solution. To accelerate the problem solving process, a parallel computation scheme is implemented for obtaining the trajectory sensitivities. The validity of the proposed algorithm and parallel computation scheme was tested and verified using two different power systems.
