Abstract: This paper presents a distributed, robust, finite-time secondary control for both voltage and frequency restoration of an islanded microgrid with droop-controlled inverter-based distributed generators (DGs). The distributed cooperative secondary control is fully distributed (i.e., uses only the information of neighboring DGs that can communicate with one another through a sparse communication network). In contrast to existing distributed methods that require a detailed model of the system (such as line impedances, loads, other DG units parameters, and even the microgrid configuration, which are practically unknown), the proposed protocols are synthesized by considering the unmodeled dynamics, unknown disturbances, and uncertainties in their models. The other novel idea in this paper is that the consensus-based distributed controllers restore the islanded microgrid's voltage magnitudes and frequency to their reference values for all DGs within finite time, irrespective of parametric uncertainties, unmodeled dynamics, and disturbances, while providing accurate real-power sharing. Moreover, the proposed method considers the coupling between the frequency and voltage of the islanded microgrid. Unlike conventional distributed controllers, the proposed approach quickly reaches consensus and exhibits a more accurate robust performance. Finally, we verify the proposed control strategy's performance using the MATLAB/SimPowerSystems toolbox.

Abstract: Distributed renewable energy resources have attracted significant attention in recent years due to the falling cost of the renewable energy technology, extensive federal and state incentives, and the application in improving load-point reliability. This growing proliferation, however, is changing the traditional consumption load curves by adding considerable levels of variability and further challenging the electricity supply-demand balance. In this paper, the application of microgrids in effectively capturing the distribution network net load variability, caused primarily by the prosumers, is investigated. Microgrids provide a viable and localized solution to this challenge, while removing the need for costly investments by the electric utility on reinforcing the existing electricity infrastructure. A flexibility-oriented microgrid optimal scheduling model is proposed and developed to coordinate the microgrid net load with the aggregated consumers/prosumers net load in the distribution network with a focus on ramping issues. The proposed coordination is performed to capture both inter-and intra-hour net load variabilities. Numerical simulations on a test distribution feeder with one microgrid and several consumers and prosumers exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: In the critical infrastructure domain, there exist two distinct players, i.e., attackers and defenders, with contradictory strategies to achieve their winnings. This paper proposes a game-theoretic approach to capture the plausible attack-defense dynamics for power transmission grids in a controlled environment. The stratagems of attackers and defenders can be modeled with unique attributes of their motives and emergency responses. The behaviors of attackers include observation and disruptive actions that can disturb operation while defenders can establish multiple levels of defense with remedial actions for risk mitigation. With an assumption of complete information, the defenders can minimize expected loss of load and generator tripping with load generation adjustment based on current conditions. The attackers, which represent the other force, can maximize their payoff by deploying persistent agents to target on the specific points within a power operation network. The boundary between these two, referred as subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, is proposed in the dynamic game model. This model initiates an original infinite game tree that is converted into a finite structure, which is solved using a backward induction approach with multiple scenario validations.

Abstract: Power distribution systems are transitioning from a traditional single distribution system operator (DSO) to a more integrated flexible network that incorporates multiple microgrids (MGs). This paper presents a novel stochastic framework to investigate the impact of correlated wind generators on energy management of DSO and MGs. In order to decouple the problem formulation in DSO and MGs, a linear approximation is proposed which enables parallel processing of the optimization problems. Further, a stochastic framework based on improved point estimate method is proposed to model the uncertainties in load and wind generation, and account for the statistical correlations among wind generators. The proposed method is applied to a modified IEEE 69 bus test feeder and the results are validated in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of how to regulate the collective charging load of a large fleet of plug-in electric taxies (PETs) in a metropolis from the viewpoint of utility company. Because the charging load of PET is much higher and less predictable compared with common private electric vehicle, the unregulated charging load of PET fleet can potentially bring large and unpredictable peaks to the distribution system and cause severe damage. To address this problem, this paper proposes a real-time pricing mechanism that can successfully regulate the collective charging load to track a given load profile. The mechanism design consists of three steps. First, we propose two aggregated models for PET fleet to characterize, separately, the relationship between charging decisions of the fleet and real time prices, and the relationship between energy dynamics and charging decisions of the fleet. Then, an optimization problem is designed to calculate the optimal charging load profile that can be accomplished by the fleet. Finally, an efficient online method is launched to calculate proper real time prices, such that the collective charging load of fleet can track the desired value as the response to the prices. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.

Abstract: The interactions between distribution and transmission systems have increased significantly in recent years. However, in traditional power system simulation tools, transmission and distribution systems are separately modeled and analyzed. Hence, it is difficult to analyze the impacts of distribution systems on transmission systems and their interactions in detail. To facilitate the analysis of integrated transmission and distribution (T&D) systems, a novel modeling framework is proposed in this paper, where the transmission system is modeled as one subsystem in three-sequence detail, while each distribution system connected to it is represented as a subsystem and modeled in three-phase detail. With this modeling approach, unbalanced conditions at the boundary between T&D systems and within the transmission system can be represented. The integrated T&D power flow is solved by iteratively solving a three-sequence power flow for the transmission system and a three-phase power flow for each distribution system. Furthermore, a new dynamic simulation algorithm for integrated T&D system is proposed. The main challenge in developing this integrated T&D dynamic simulation is associated with different network representations in the transmission and distribution systems. With a partitioned solution approach adopted for dynamic simulation, the multi-area Thevenin equivalent approach is utilized in the network solution step to address this challenge. The proposed algorithms have been tested against an all electromagnetic transient simulation.

Abstract: The effect of bus-bar splitting on the static stability limit is studied in this paper. A novel online bus-bar splitting methodology is developed to increase the static stability limit of a look-ahead (i.e., short term, say, 30 minutes ahead) power system. The proposed methodology, designed for online application, is based on a strategy consisting of screening, ranking, and decision stages. A tailored model of bus-bar splitting is developed to accurately model bus-bar splitting scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed online bus-bar splitting methodology is evaluated on the IEEE 118-bus, 1648-bus, and 3120-bus power systems. Results indicate that significant load margin increases can be achieved by bus-bar splitting.

Abstract: The dynamics of load, especially induction motors, are the driving force for short-term voltage stability (STVS) problems. In this paper, the equivalent rotation speed of motors is identified online and its recovery time is estimated next to realize an emergency-demand-response (EDR) based under speed load shedding (USLS) scheme to improve STVS. The proposed scheme consists of an EDR program and two regular stages (RSs). In the EDR program, contracted load is used as a fast-response resource rather than the last defense. The estimated recovery time (ERT) is used as the triggering signal for the EDR program. In the RSs, the amount of load to be shed at each bus is determined according to the assigned weights based on ERTs. Case studies on a practical power system in China Southern Power Grid have validated the performance of the proposed USLS scheme under various contingency scenarios. The utilization of EDR resources and the adaptive distribution of shedding amount in RSs guarantee faster voltage recovery. Therefore, USLS offers a new and more effective approach compared with existing under voltage load shedding to improve STVS.

Abstract: A coordinated economic dispatch method for multi-area power systems is proposed. Choosing boundary phase angles as coupling variables, the proposed method exploits the structure of critical regions in local problems defined by active and inactive constraints. For a fixed boundary state given by the coordinator, local operators compute the coefficients of critical regions containing the boundary state and the optimal value functions then communicate them to the coordinator who in turn optimizes the boundary state to minimize the overall cost. By iterating between local operators and the coordinator, the proposed algorithm converges to the global optimal solution in finite steps, and it requires limited information sharing.

Abstract: Historical electrical disturbances highlight the impact of extreme weather on power system resilience. Even though the occurrence of such events is rare, the severity of their potential impact calls for 1) developing suitable resilience assessment techniques to capture their impacts and 2) assessing relevant strategies to mitigate them. This paper aims to provide fundamentals insights on the modeling and quantification of power systems resilience. Specifically, a fragility model of individual components and then of the whole transmission system is built for mapping the real-time impact of severe weather, with focus on wind events, on their failure probabilities. A probabilistic multitemporal and multiregional resilience assessment methodology, based on optimal power flow and sequential Monte Carlo simulation, is then introduced, allowing the assessment of the spatiotemporal impact of a windstorm moving across a transmission network. Different risk-based resilience enhancement (or adaptation) measures are evaluated, which are driven by the resilience achievement worth index of the individual transmission components. The methodology is demonstrated using a test version of the Great Britain's system. As key outputs, the results demonstrate how, by using a mix of infrastructure and operational indices, it is possible to effectively quantify system resilience to extreme weather, identify and prioritize critical network sections, whose criticality depends on the weather intensity, and assess the technical benefits of different adaptation measures to enhance resilience.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new control strategy for the reactive-power injections of voltage-source converters (VSCs) in high-voltage direct-current multi-terminal systems to improve power system transient stability. A reactive-power supplementary signal is provided for each converter. Its value is proportional to the frequency deviation of its corresponding AC bus with respect to the weighed-average frequency of the multi-terminal system stations. The purpose is to increase (decrease) the electromagnetic torque of generators close to those terminals, in which the frequency is above (below) the weighed-average frequency used. The AC frequency for all VSC stations is always available locally for synchronization purposes and could be used by a central controller. Simulations have been carried out using PSS/E, and the results have shown that transient stability can be improved using this strategy. Since this approach uses global measurements of all VSC stations, the impact of the communication delays has been analyzed, concluding that the negative effect is small, for realistic latency values.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate maintenance effects on system reliability and transmission network expansion planning considering line loading and repairs. For this purpose, the maintenance cost is formulated taking into account transient and permanent forced outage rates, as well as durations of planned and forced outage. Also, transmission reliability is modeled considering load shedding (LS) and energy not supplied (ENS) criteria. LS index is calculated for transient forced outages and ENS criterion is computed for permanent forced outages, and planned outage rates and durations. Furthermore, the effects of line loadings on transmission system reliability are formulated through the transient and permanent forced outage rates. The proposed model was tested on the IEEE 24-bus and 30-bus test systems, and the results are discussed.

Abstract: This paper presents a method to derive the optimal offering/bidding strategy of a power producer who owns a hybrid power station (HPS), comprising wind farms (WFs) and pumped-hydro storage. The method is in line with the provisions of the Greek grid code for non-interconnected islands regarding the operation of HPSs. The goal of the HPS producer is to construct a single energy offer/bid for the total daily production/absorption, which maximizes his profits in the day-ahead market and minimizes any imbalance penalties during real-time operation. To this purpose, a two-stage stochastic bilevel optimization model is formulated, where the uncertainty lies in the wind power production of both the WFs belonging to the hybrid producer (internal WFs-IWFs) and the WFs belonging to other independent producers (WFs external to the HPS-EWFs). The upper level of the proposed bilevel model represents the hybrid producer's profit maximization, while the lower level represents the system operator's (SO) market clearing problem. This stochastic bilevel model is finally converted to a mixed-integer linear programming model in order to be tractable. Finally, simulation results from two test cases are thoroughly discussed and useful conclusions are drawn.

Abstract: The main framework of a new adaptive coordinated voltage control (ACVC) has been presented and published in our previous paper. ACVC is realized based on knowledge exploration from nondominated solution sets of multiobjective optimization. Knowledge is prepared and accumulated from offline training and online learning processes. This facilitates fast responses. An important basic work is to further study knowledge sensitivity to power system characteristics such that the efficiency of ACVC for various dynamics of power systems can be improved. A comparative study and discussion of power system scale, allocation of control devices, operational point variations, and severity of emergencies are presented in this paper. An improved form of knowledge is also proposed for ACVC based on these discussions. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 39-bus, 118-bus, and 300-bus power systems are performed for comparison and discussion.

Abstract: This paper presents a bilevel optimization model for the risk assessment of transmission systems. Specifically, the lower level model is expected to provide a generation redispatch by minimizing the total load shedding, and the upper-level model is to maximize the severity risk by constructing a binary optimization model to identify the worst N-k contingency. To further reduce the complexity of the proposed model, the logarithmic transformation and linearization techniques are utilized, leading to a general mixed integer linear programming. In addition, a recursive method is proposed for contingency ranking based on the bilevel optimization model. Compared with the benchmark analytic method, the proposed method does not need to enumerate every contingency, reducing the computational burden. In contrast to the traditional Monte Carlo Simulation method, the proposed method can give as precise a risk assessment result as the analytic method and has higher evaluation efficiency. Numerical results on three test systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: In certain electricity markets, because of nonconvexities that arise from their operating characteristics, generators that follow the independent system operator's (ISO's) decisions may fail to recover their cost through sales of energy at locational marginal prices. The ISO makes discriminatory side payments to incentivize the compliance of generators. Convex hull pricing is a uniform pricing scheme that minimizes these side payments. The Lagrangian dual problem of the unit commitment problem has been solved in the dual space to determine convex hull prices. However, this approach is computationally expensive. We propose a polynomially solvable primal formulation for the Lagrangian dual problem. This formulation explicitly describes for each generating unit the convex hull of its feasible set and the convex envelope of its cost function. We cast our formulation as a second-order cone program when the cost functions are quadratic, and a linear program when the cost functions are piecewise linear. A 96-period 76-unit transmission-constrained example is solved in less than 15 s on a personal computer.

Abstract: As power system operation conditions vary, the system may move into critical operating conditions with oscillatory behaviors. In this paper, a generation rescheduling method is proposed for damping critical modes so that oscillations can be suppressed. This proposed method calculates the analytical eigenvalue sensitivity to identify the most effective generators for rescheduling to enhance the damping of the critical mode, thereby suppressing the oscillations. The eigenvalue sensitivity calculation is based on the structure-preserving network representation and the generalized eigenvalue problem. Numerical evaluation of the proposed method is performed with a focus on mode shape and participation factor analysis. The results show that the proposed method is effective in controlling power system oscillations via generation rescheduling.

Abstract: This paper develops a generalized energy management approach for smart microgrids (MGs) with the collaboration of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging facilities in both active and reactive powers exchange. In addition to the monetary saving and economical benefits, this feature reveals a promising opportunity for power quality improvement in modern MGs. To do this, an efficient multi-objective framework is proposed for the optimal operation scheduling of MGs. The optimization model incorporates the full potential benefits of PEV fleets in balancing both active and reactive powers supply and demand. The multi-objective formulation lies within a mixed-integer linear programming fashion, which is tackled by epsilon-constraint method. A quadruple linear operating area is envisioned for PEV fleet inverters caped with the maximum apparent power limit. A suitable voltage-dependent load model, with negligible error, is deployed to tailor the proposed approach for real-world applications. The new methodology is successfully applied to a 33-bus test MG with illustrative case studies. The obtained results are reported in terms of voltage profile improvement, released capacity of generating units, moderated operation of under-load tap changers, and MG operation cost reduction.

Abstract: Distributed optimization for solving nonconvex optimal power flow (OPF) problems in power systems has attracted considerable attention in the last decade. Most studies are based on the geographical decomposition of the IEEE test systems for verifying the feasibility of the proposed approaches. However, it is not clear if one can extrapolate from these studies that similar approaches can also be applied to very large-scale real-world systems. In this paper, we show, for the first time, that distributed optimization can be effectively applied to a large-scale real transmission network, namely, the Polish 2383-bus system for which no predefined partitions exist, by using a recently developed partitioning technique. More specifically, the problem solved is the ac OPF problem with geographical decomposition of the network using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method in conjunction with the partitioning technique. Through extensive simulations and analytical studies, we show that with the presented partitioning technique the convergence performance of the ADMM method can be improved substantially, which enables the application of distributed approaches to very large-scale systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a fast optimization approach framework for the DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) with the consideration of transmission losses, which is confronted with non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming. Specifically, a second-order cone programming-based Lagrangian relaxation method is employed to obtain the lower bound of the original DCOPF. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for the zero-gap relaxation is derived, which is easy to be satisfied in practice. Finally, the comparison with existing DCOPF solvers shows that the proposed method could achieve the global optimal solution and jump out of the local optimality. Also, the comparison with the widely used semidefinite programming relaxation approach indicates that the proposed relaxation method needs less dummy variables, and thus can be more efficiently solved and more applicable for large-scale power systems.

Abstract: In this paper, for the first time, electric vehicles are used for both the primary and secondary frequency controls to support power plants to rapidly suppress fluctuations in the system frequency due to load disturbances. Via networked control and wide-area communication infrastructures, multiple interval time-varying delays exist in the communication channels between the control center, power plant, and an aggregation of electric vehicles. By coordinating batteries' state of charge control, the behaviors of the vehicle owners and the uncertainties imposed by the changes of the batteries' state of charge are taken into consideration. A power system model incorporating multiple time-varying delays and uncertainties is first proposed. Then, a robust static output feedback frequency controller is designed to guarantee the resulting closed-loop system stable with an H-infinity attenuation level. By utilizing a novel integral inequality, namely refined-Jensen inequality, and an improved reciprocally convex combination, the design conditions are formulated in terms of tractable linear matrix inequalities which can be efficiently solved by various computational tools. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by extensive simulations.

Abstract: Control strategies for power swing damping which use wide-area feedback signals need to be robust to partial/complete loss of communication and changes in operating points and topology. In addition, they should have a positive effect on all controllable swing modes and ensure adequate stability margins to avoid destabilization of untargeted modes. This paper proposes a control strategy for multiple embedded dc links (multiterminal or multiinfeed), which has all these attributes and is inherently able to provide wideband damping. The strategy uses only a limited set of nonlocal signals. These signals may be directly communicated to the dc links without having to be centrally collated with other system-wide measurements, thereby reducing communication delays. The strategy can easily be adapted during power system operation to achieve targeted damping of the critical swing modes.

Abstract: This paper proposes a model reduction technique that simplifies the dynamic equations of complex power networks, using sparse representations of the system matrices. Instead of removing components from the state vector, elements from the system matrices are eliminated such that these matrices become sparse. This is achieved by three different numeric algorithms that approximate the original system model using fewer nonzero elements. These algorithms lead to simpler models, since the complexity of operations involving sparse matrices is primarily affected by the matrices density. Furthermore, this approach enables to identify significant dynamic relations between units in the network. The proposed methods are demonstrated on several test-case systems with 9 and 2383-buses. In these examples, more than 90% of the elements in the system matrices are eliminated.

Abstract: The influence of complementarity balancing connected grid and control of offshore wind power generation on the economic and reliable operation of hybrid multiterminal HVDC (MTDC) and AC power system is investigated in the paper. The variances of distribution curve of both transmission loss of AC/DC system and voltage of critical nodes assessed by cumulant-based method are used to demonstrate how the different complementarity conditions, generation balancing strategies, MTDC grid topologies, and control schemes affect power system operation. In this paper, a study case of 16-generator 68-bus power system connected with three offshore wind farms is presented. The variance indices of transmission loss and voltage magnitude are calculated and then compared under different complementarity levels, active power balancing strategies, HVDC transmission systems, and controls, respectively. The analysis reveals that higher complementarity and multi-machine balancing strategy can effectively reduce system operational cost and enhance operational reliability. Compared to the point-to-point topology, the control pattern and parameter setting of multi-terminal topology are two key factors to determine its impact on system operation.

Abstract: Widespread three-phase imbalance causes inefficient uses of low voltage (LV) network assets, leading to additional reinforcement costs (ARCs). Previous work that assumed balanced three phases underestimated the reinforcement cost throughout the whole utility by more than 50%. Previous work that quantified the ARCs was limited to individual network components, relying on full sensory data. This paper proposes a novel methodology that will scale the ARC estimation at a utility level, when the data concerning the imbalance of circuits or transformers are scarce. A novel statistical method is developed to estimate the volume of assets that need to be invested by identifying the relationship between the triangular distribution of circuit imbalance and that of circuit utilization. When there are more data available in future, accurate probability distributions can be constructed to reflect the network condition across the whole system. In light of this, two novel generalized ARC estimation formulas are developed that account for generic probability distributions. The developed methodology is applied to a real utility system in the UK, showing that: 1) three-phase imbalance leads to ARCs that are even greater than the reinforcement costs in the balanced case; 2) a 1% increase in the demand growth rate, the maximum degree of imbalance (DIB) and the maximum nominal utilization rate leads to over 10%, approximately 1% and 2% increases in the ARCs, respectively; and 3) the ARC is not sensitive to the minimum DIB values and the minimum nominal utilization rates.

Abstract: This study proposes the demand-side power procurement problem to optimally reduce consumer's energy cost. The motivation stems from pressing issues on an increase of energy cost in an industrial section. From an energy consumer's perspective, there exists an opportunity to reduce energy cost by adjusting purchase and consumption of energy in response to time-varying electricity price while utilizing renewable energy, which is called demand response. In this case, energy storage can be used to mitigate fluctuation of intermittent renewable supply and volatile electricity price. Although it is anticipated to serve a significant amount of energy consumption from renewable energy and to avoid peak electricity price, variability and uncertainty in power demand, renewable supply, and electricity price make it challenging to determine an optimal power procurement. The main objective of this study is to suggest a decision-making methodology that enables energy consumers to optimally determine power procurement against time varying and stochastic electricity price and renewable supply. Specifically, this study formulates an optimal day-ahead power procurement as a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer program and proposes a solution approach based on Benders decomposition. The proposed methodology can be successfully applied to energy-intensive industries, such as data centers.

Abstract: Stochastic optimal power flow (OPF) formulations that minimize the expected operating costs over forecast scenarios generally result in lower costs than the standard (deterministic) OPF problem for power systems with significant forecast error, for example, from renewable energy sources. However, this type of stochastic OPF problem is more computationally demanding than the deterministic OPF, and even more so when storage units or ramp-constrained generators are included, as they require solving a multi-period OPF problem. We propose a hybrid method approaching the cost performance of the stochastic OPF problem and the computational burden of the deterministic OPF problem. Our method decomposes the problem into stochastic and deterministic subproblems, and relies on Benders' Cuts to interface them. We present three versions of the method, which achieve different cost/computational burden trade-offs. The versions can be parametrized so that they scale well with the problem dimension. For one of the versions, we develop a multi-dimensional formulation of the Sandwich Algorithm, which is used to iteratively approximate a convex function. Through a case study using a 118-bus system, we find that our hybrid method achieves between 25% and 81% of the cost improvement of the stochastic OPF, but requires only 12 to 41% of the increased computation time required by the stochastic OPF. Both the hybrid method and the multi-dimensional Sandwich Algorithm can be used for problems outside of the field of power systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven method based on distributionally robust optimization to determine the maximum penetration level of distributed generation (DG) for active distribution networks. In our method, the uncertain DG outputs and load demands are formulated as stochastic variables following some ambiguous distributions. In addition to the given expectations and variances, the polyhedral uncertainty intervals are employed for the construction of the probability distribution set to restrict possible distributions. Then, we decide the optimal sizes and locations of DG to maximize the total DG hosting capacity under the worst-case probability distributions among this set. Since more information is utilized, our proposed model is expected to be less conservative than the robust optimization method and the traditional distributionally robust method. Using the CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) reformulation technique and strong duality, we transform the proposed model into an equivalent bilinear matrix inequality problem, and a sequential convex optimization algorithm is applied for solution. Our model guarantees that the probability of security constraints being violated will not exceed a given risk threshold. Besides, the predefined risk level can be tuned to control the conservativeness of our model in a physically meaningful way. The effectiveness and robustness of this proposed method are demonstrated numerically on the two modified IEEE test systems.

Abstract: Over the past several years, great strides have been made in the effort to monitor the small-signal stability of power systems. These efforts focus on estimating electromechanical modes, which are a property of the system that dictate how generators in different parts of the system exchange energy. Though the algorithms designed for this task are powerful and important for reliable operation of the power system, they are susceptible to severe bias when forced oscillations are present in the system. Forced oscillations are fundamentally different from electromechanical oscillations in that they are the result of a rogue input to the system, rather than a property of the system itself. To address the presence of forced oscillations, the frequently used AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) model is adapted to include sinusoidal inputs, resulting in the AutoRegressive Moving Average plus Sinusoid (ARMA+S) model. From this model, a new Two-Stage Least Squares algorithm is derived to incorporate the forced oscillations, thereby enabling the simultaneous estimation of the electromechanical modes and the amplitude and phase of the forced oscillations. The method is validated using simulated power system data as well as data obtained from the western North American power system and Eastern Interconnection.

Abstract: This paper develops enhanced hybrid generic (nonlinear) models of Type-3 and Type-4 wind power plants (WPPs) and extracts the corresponding linear (small-signal) dynamic models for power system transient stability analysis. The models are hybrid in nature since they consider both continuous states and discrete logic-controlled variables. The introduced enhancements include (i) a freezing function to reactivate reactive power emulator of Type-3 and Type-4 WPPs, (ii) active-current command recalculation step for Type-3 WPP and (iii) elimination of an activating logic of PI-controller limits in real current control path. The main feature of the enhanced models is that they can replicate the field-verified responses of the built-in PSS/E software models in any adopted software platform. It should be noted that the generic models described in the technical literature do not necessarily provide such replication. The paper also deduces small-signal dynamic models of Type-3 and Type-4 WPPs and addresses the multiple eigen structures of the linearized enhanced generic model of Type-3 WPP, which has not been comprehensively discussed in the technical literature. The enhanced nonlinear hybrid models and the corresponding linearized models are evaluated and verified based on time-domain simulation studies in PSS/E and MATLAB platforms, using NPCC system as the test bed.

Abstract: With the increasing use of voltage source converters (VSCs) in power electronics dominated power systems, oscillation phenomena in DC-link voltage control (DVC) timescale (around 10 Hz) among multiple VSCs have occurred. Several studies have tried to analyze these oscillation problems, but all associated with the single VSC situation. To consider the dynamic interactions between VSCs in DVC timescale, especially in the weak grid condition, this paper presents a small-signal model to understand VSC external characteristics based on motion equation concept also featured in synchronous generator (SG). Comparisons of time-domain simulation responses and eigenvalues show that the proposed model can hold the main behaviors of concern. The form of the model is very similar to the rotor motion equation in SG, with which power engineers have been very familiar. In addition, by establishing the relationship between the unbalanced powers and state variables of internal voltage (viz., VSC output voltage), the modeling idea introduced in this paper can be applied to other power electronic devices.

Abstract: Power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) simulation allows the connection of a physical power component (e.g., photovoltaic inverter) to a real-time simulated network. In this paper, PHIL simulation is used for laboratory education in a systematic way for the first time. Four important topics for the understanding of power system operation are selected and laboratory exercises are designed, respectively. The topics focus on the effects of increased integration of distributed generation (DG), namely, power sharing between synchronous generators and DG, voltage control with on load tap changer and DG, short circuits with inverter-based DG, and microgrid operation. The exercises start from the operation of the traditional power system and gradually incorporate DG-related topics that show both benefits and challenges. A hands-on approach is supported by the appropriate lab configuration consisting of two independent PHIL setups. The assessment of the laboratory exercises by the students is clearly positive underlining the value of PHIL simulation for power system education.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for the analysis of frequency dynamics in large-scale power systems with high level of wind energy penetration by means of a simplified model for DFIG-based wind turbines. In addition, a virtual inertia controller version of the optimized power point tracking (OPPT) method is implemented for this kind of wind turbines, where the maximum power point tracking curve is shifted to drive variations in the active power injection as a function of both the grid frequency deviation and its time derivative. The proposed methodology integrates the model in a primary frequency control scheme to analyze the interaction with the rest of the plants in the power system. It is also proven that, under real wind conditions, the proposed version of the OPPT method allows us to smooth the wind power injected into the grid, thereby reducing frequency fluctuations.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for robust stability analysis of large-scale power systems based on the value set approach. The order of the system is first reduced by the dimension reduction and modal truncation to capture the oscillation modes of interest. The characteristic polynomial is then obtained by the diagonal expansion, which allows the structure of coefficient functions to be exploited. The Mikhailov plot is generated with ease using the edge theorem and mapping theorem, and by inspection of the plot, the uncertainty's impact becomes transparent. The performance of the proposed method is tested on a 547-machine 8647-bus model of the actual North China system. The results of several case studies are reported, and related works are reviewed for comparison.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel model for two-stage adaptive robust transmission expansion planning (AR-TEP) problem considering the uncertainty of future load demand and future wind power production. Linear decision rules (LDRs) are utilized to reformulate the AR-TEP model as a tractable mixed-integer linear programming problem, which can be directly solved by off-the-shelf optimization packages. The proposed LDR-based AR-TEP model is illustrated using the Garver 6-bus test system, the IEEE 24-bus reliability test system, and a 236-bus test system under different conditions and compared with a decomposition-based AR-TEP model that uses primal cutting planes. Also, the robustness of the expansion plans obtained from these two AR-TEP models is evaluated by carrying out an ex-post out-of-sample analysis for different values of the budget of uncertainty. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LDR-based AR-TEP model.

Abstract: A new, unscented transformation (UT) based probabilistic power flow method for Alternate Current/Voltage Source Control-Multiple Terminal Direct Current hybrid grids is presented herein. The method is able to accurately tackle various random variables, including renewable energy sources with uncertainties such as wind speeds and solar radiations, which are rank correlated and are likely to follow different types of probability distributions. The concept of Gaussian copula is adopted to transform the rank correlated random variables into a group of standard Gaussian distributions with Pearson correlation coefficients, so that the UT method can be later applied to select the critical sample points from Gaussian distributions in a proper and uniform way. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a set of test results on the modified IEEE 39-bus system and IEEE 300-bus system.

Abstract: The distributed secondary control in a microgrid can be used for complementing the function of the primary droop-based control. However, its dynamic performance may be undesirable and furthermore it may introduce new less-damped modes to the system leading to oscillatory responses. Unfortunately, mechanism analysis of the undesirable dynamic performance and the possible oscillations, and more importantly, stabilization of the microgrid with the distributed secondary control have not been reported. To fill this gap, this paper first develops a unified small-signal dynamic model of the microgrid. Based on the developed model, a small-signal stability analysis is utilized to perform the aforementioned mechanism analysis. A distributed optimal controller is thereafter proposed to enhance the system stability and improve the system dynamic performance. The distributed optimal controller can coordinate multiple distributed generation units in the microgrid and exhibits robust performance under a wide range of operating conditions. Finally, theoretical analysis and time-domain simulation results on a benchmark microgrid system are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: A new graph dual formalism is presented for the analysis of line outages in electricity networks. The dual formalism is based on a consideration of the flows around closed cycles in the network. After some exposition of the theory is presented, a new formula for the computation of line outage distribution factors is derived, which is not only computationally faster than existing methods, but also generalizes easily for multiple line outages and arbitrary changes to line series reactance. In addition, the dual formalism provides new physical insight for how the effects of line outages propagate through the network. For example, in a planar network a single-line outage can be shown to induce monotonically decreasing flow changes, which are mathematically equivalent to an electrostatic dipole field.

Abstract: Concerning the stochastic excitation caused by wind power fluctuation and the stochastic parameter of virtual inertia caused by wind speed uncertainty, a power system stability analysis method considering the Wiener noise is proposed in this paper. First, based on the reduced-order model of DFIG retaining virtual inertia control and phase-locked loop (phase-locked loop) dynamics, the analytic function relationship between stochastic parameters and elements in the state matrix is derived using the sensitivity analysis method; thus, the model of interconnected system with stochastic parameters considering the Wiener noise is established. And by constructing the Lyapunov functional containing the model of stochastic parameters, the linear matrix inequality (LMI) that satisfies the robust stochastic stability criterion is derived. Furthermore, by transforming the solving of LMI to a feasibility problem, the stability of system is identified. And then, by calculating online system instability probability under the current operating condition, the probability stability analysis method is proposed. On this basis, a system stochastic stability degree index is defined in this paper, which quantifies the effect of stochastic parameters on system small-signal stability, and could provide more effective information for the safe and stable operation of power system. Simulation tests on the IEEE four-generator two-area system and the New England 10-machine 39-bus system verify that the proposed method could effectively identify the small-signal stability of power system under the joint influence of stochastic parameter and stochastic external excitation, and is applicable to complex system with multiple generators.

Abstract: In this paper, the concept of locational marginal price (LMP) is revisited by analyzing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition of a general optimal power flow (OPF) problem. The impact of losses on LMP is investigated. Several well-known properties and formulations of the LMP are illustrated from a novel perspective. In particular, the special case of the lossless DC OPF model is discussed. Based on this theoretical analysis, a linear model for the loss-embedded LMP is proposed. The influence of losses on the LMP is recovered by solving a system of linear equations. The proposed method does not rely on strong subjective assumptions, such as the selection of reference buses or the determination of the "loss factor." Case studies show that the proposed method has distinct advantages compared with the method currently practiced in major electricity markets.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust predictive load frequency control for power systems with uncertain parameters and time delays in communication networks. The goal of the proposed approach is to achieve good performance for the closed-loop system under practical problems of the network including uncertainties in the dynamic model, time delays in the system, and time-varying model. To this end, a decentralized state-feedback control law is obtained by solving an linear matrix inequality based optimization. The aim of the optimization problem is to regularize the frequency deviation with the minimum control effort. It is shown that the stability of the system is guaranteed with respect to the Lyapunov stability theorem. Moreover, the problem is reformulated as a centralized load frequency control (LFC) approach for single-area power systems, and also as a non-predictive LFC method with lower computational complexity. The performance and robustness of the proposed strategy are studied through simulation results in different cases of uncertain and time-varying single-area and multi-area power systems with time delays.

Abstract: The paper proposes a stochastic model to analyse the dynamic coupling of the transmission system, the electricity market, and microgrids. The focus is on the impact of microgrids on the transient response of the system and, in particular, on frequency variations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are performed on the IEEE 39-bus system, and show that the dynamic response of the transmission system is affected in a nontrivial way by both the number and the size of the microgrids.

Abstract: This paper investigates a resilient event-triggering H-infinity load frequency control (LFC) for multi-area power systems with energy-limited Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The LFC design specifically takes the presence of DoS attacks into account. First, an area control error dependent time delay model is delicately constructed for multi-area closed-loop power systems. Second, a resilient event-triggering communication (RETC) scheme is well designed, which allows a degree of packet losses induced by DoS attacks and has the advantage of improving the transaction efficiency. Then, by using the Lyapunov theory, two stability and stabilization criteria for the multi-area power systems are derived under consideration of the energy-limited DoS attacks. In these criteria, the relationship between the allowable DoS attack duration and the resilient event-triggering communication parameters are clearly revealed. Moreover, an algorithm is also provided to obtain the RETC parameters and the LFC gains simultaneously. Finally, a case study shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: To coordinate electric vehicle (EV) charging, the EV aggregator (EVA) is usually assumed to obtain the privilege from EV owners (EVOs) to determine the EV charging profile, and complex communication between EVA and EVOs is demanded, which poses difficulties for practical applications. In contrast, this paper proposes the concept of an EV chargeable region to evaluate the distribution network (DN) EV hosting capacity, i.e., how much EV charging demand can be accommodated in a DN, within which the technical constraints of DN (e.g., voltage deviation) are guaranteed and EVOs' charging requests are maximally ensured. The optimization of the EV chargeable region is formulated as a two-stage robust optimization model with adjustable uncertainty set. The EV chargeable region and DN decision variables are optimized in the first stage and the feasibility in the real-time worst-case scenario is checked in the second stage, considering the uncertainty of EV charging demand and DN active and reactive power. A modified column and constraint generation and outer approximation method is adopted to address the proposed problem. Simulations on an IEEE 123-node DN demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impacts of transient instability on power system reliability. Traditionally, composite system reliability evaluation has been performed based on steady-state estimation of load curtailments; system dynamics have often been ignored, mostly due to computational complexity. In this paper, three probabilistic transient stability indices are proposed to assess system robustness against dynamic contingencies and to account for system instability in computing reliability indices. A direct method is utilized for transient stability assessment based on computing the energy margin of the system under fault events (energy margins measure the ability of a system to withstand contingencies). Energy margins along with the probability of occurrences of the events are used to update the probabilistic transient stability indices. The dependencies of reliability and stability indices on the fault clearing time are also evaluated. This method is applied on the reduced Western Electricity Coordinating Council and the New England 39 bus test systems. The results indicate the importance of considering the effect of stability in reliability evaluation.

Abstract: Reliability costs are used to evaluate the influence of large-scale wind power integration on security constrained unit commitment (SCUC), but the nonlinear expressions of reliability costs increase the complexity of the SCUC model. To address this issue, this letter presents a novel variant to exactly linearize the nonlinear expressions. Compared with the traditional approach, the proposed variant can reduce the number of binary variables, such that the computational performance of the SCUC model is significantly improved. Numerical results of the IEEE reliability test system verify the effectiveness of the proposed variant.

Abstract: This letter is an enhancement to our previous paper that quantifies additional reinforcement costs (ARCs) for low-voltage assets under moderate degree of three-phase imbalance. The original formulas cause an overestimation of the ARCs under severe imbalance. This letter first quantifies the threshold of the severe degree of imbalance (DIB), below which the original formulas are applicable. Then, the ARC formulas are extended to account for the whole range of DIB. Case studies demonstrate that when the asset loading level is below 33.3% (50%) for a feeder (a transformer), the DIB never exceeds the threshold and the original ARC formulas are applicable; otherwise, the DIB can exceed the threshold and the extended formulas yield correct ARCs.

Abstract: Forming multiple micorgrids with distributed generators offers a resilient solution to restore critical loads from natural disasters in distribution systems. However, more dummy binary and continuous variables are needed with the increase of the number of microgrids, which will therefore increase the complexity of this model. To address this issue, this letter presents a new model to reformulatethe micorgrid formulation problem in resilient distribution networks. Compared with the traditional model, the number of both binary and continuous variables is greatly reduced, such that the computational performance is significantly improved. Numerical results on IEEE test systems verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.
