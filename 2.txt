Abstract: Several hierarchical centralized control schemes for either rotor angle or voltage stability improvement have been proposed in the literature. They all rely on exchanging information between different subsystems of a large-scale power system. By contrast, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical decentralized control scheme to enhance a unified manner rotor angle and voltage stability while using metered values collected within each subsystem, without any exchange of information between subsystems. Specifically, weakly coupled coherent areas of a power system are first determined. Then, secondary control agents are implemented in each of them to detect and damp rotor angle and voltage instabilities using local synchrophasor measurements. Decentralized control laws based on Lyapunov theory are implemented on FACTS devices for achieving global rotor angle asymptotic stability. Finally, a tertiary voltage control agent provides reference settings to the secondary voltage agents and takes control actions in case the latter fail to damp voltage instabilities. We show that the proposed scheme minimizes the communication bandwidth requirement while exhibiting a system-wide situational awareness. Simulations carried out on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical decentralized control method.

Abstract: This study proposes a fully decentralized secondary voltage control scheme which employs the state estimation method in autonomous microgrids. Based on a large-signal dynamic model of a microgrid, a linear parameter varying based state estimator that is localized in each distributed generation (DG) unit serves as an alternative communication role and obtains the dynamics of the other DG units independently. A linear matrix inequality formulation for pole placement condition is derived for the state estimator design. A decentralized secondary voltage controller is, thus, able to achieve accurate reactive power sharing and average voltage restoration without any additional communication links. Our approach offers superior reliability, flexibility, and economic efficiency because of the irrelevance of communications to its performance, which is essential when conventional centralized or distributed methods are likely to yield towards poor performance or even instability under communication latency or data drop-out conditions. Simulation results that verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology are provided.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new method to solve the multistage security-constrained transmission expansion planning problem, incorporating lines based on high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) alternatives. A novel mixed-integer linear programming model, which incorporates transmission losses using a piecewise linearization, is presented. An efficient method to reduce the search space of the problem is developed to help in the solution process. Garver's 6-bus system and a modified Southern Brazilian system are used to show the precision and efficiency of the proposed approach. The tests are performed for cases with and without HVDC links and transmission losses. The results indicate that better expansion plans can be found by considering HVDC proposals in the expansion process. The promising trend of using HVDC lines in future networks to improve the reliability in the system is demonstrated.

Abstract: Line flow calculation plays a critically important role to guarantee the stable operation of power system in economic dispatch (ED) problems with line constraints. This paper presents a line flow granular computing approach for power flow calculation to assist the investigation on ED with line constraints, where the hierarchy method is adopted to divide the power network into multiple layers to reduce computational complexity. Each layer contains granules for granular computing, and the layer network is reduced by Ward equivalent retaining the PV nodes and boundary nodes of tie lines to decrease the data dimension. Then, Newton-Raphson method is applied further to calculate the power line flows within the layer. This approach is tested on IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems. The testing results show that the granular computing approach can solve the line flow problem in 9.2 s for the IEEE 118-bus system, while the conventional AC method needs 44.56 s. The maximum relative error of the granular computing approach in line flow tests is only 0.43%, which is quite small and acceptable. Therefore, the case studies demonstrate that the proposed granular computing approach is correct, effective, and can ensure the accuracy and efficiency of power line flow calculation.

Abstract: Power system software used for analysis and dynamic simulation and relay settings require accurate model parameters of different elements for precise results. For this, transmission line parameter verification is necessary at times, which changes due to atmospheric condition and aging. This paper presents a method for estimating the parameters of series compensated line online using synchronized time-domain data captured by the intelligent electronic devices at both ends of the line, which is free of the compensation model. The method uses traveling waves generated during disturbance to obtain the propagation constant of the line, which is used to estimate the resistance and the characteristic impedance of the line. Subsequently, the inductance and capacitance of the line are calculated. The proposed method is tested using PSCAD/EMTDC simulation data of an actual series compensated line in Indian power grid. Results demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Given large-scale power networks with series compensation, the study of subsynchronous resonance (SSR) is a significant challenge, in practice, due to the model complexity and computation burden. To tackle these difficulties, this paper proposes a method to reduce a large-scale system to an equivalent model using a metric called damping sensitivity index. The proposed metric can quantitatively identify the boundaries of the equivalent model that ensure the accurate studies of SSR and reduce the computation burdens greatly. The effectiveness of the method is verified by its application to the SSR investigation of the modified IEEE New England 10-machine 39-bus system and 16-machine 68-bus system. The equivalent models obtained by the proposed method are compared with the original systems in terms of driving point impedances, electrical damping, and transient torques. These results obtained show that the equivalent models from the proposed method can reproduce the SSR dynamics of the original systems with a much shorter computation time.

Abstract: Today's electricity paradigm requires that the notion of active distribution systems be introduced at both undergraduate and graduate curricula. This involves not only the customary theoretical foundations but also a suitable power engineering laboratory, where flexible enough and affordable resources allow students and researchers to carry out hands-on experiments reinforcing the concepts explained in the classroom. This paper describes the smart grid laboratory of the Power Engineering Group at the University of Seville, composed of a scaled-down distribution system, along with the required control and monitoring equipment, designed to help its users easily grasp the major influence that distributed generation and storage devices exert in the operation of medium-voltage distribution systems.

Abstract: Development of appropriate load flow model of Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices is an important issue for proper planning, control, and protection of power system. Holomorphic Embedding Load-Flow Method (HELM) is a novel technique for solving load flow nonlinear equations which overcomes the numerical problems faced by traditional iterative techniques. In order to evaluate the effects of FACTS devices in load flow problem by HELM technique, it is necessary to develop HELM modeling of these devices. This paper presents HELM modeling of Thyristor-based FACTS controllers, i.e., Static Var Compensator (SVC), Thyristor Controlled Switched Capacitor (TCSC), Thyristor Controlled Voltage Regulator (TCVR), and Thyristor Controlled Phase Angle Regulator (TCPAR). In this modeling, white germ solution is investigated along with recursive formula and controlling FACTS devices operation bounds.

Abstract: Extending traditional deterministic economic dispatch to incorporate significant stochastic wind power is an important but challenging task in today's power system decision making. In this paper, this issue is formulated as a chance-constrained economic dispatch (CCED) problem. Usually, in the presence of non-Gaussian correlated random variables, both the objective function and constraints are difficult to handle. To address this issue, this paper provides a novelmethod dealing with non-Gaussian random variables. First, the Gaussian mixture model is adopted to represent the joint probability density function of power output for multiple wind farms. Then, analytical formulae are derived that can be used for fast computation of partial derivatives of the objective function and transformation of chance constraints into linear ones. Thereafter, the CCED can be solved as a deterministic linear convex optimization with a global optimal solution. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology are validated via a case study with a modified IEEE 39-bus system.

Abstract: Use of actuator redundancy to achieve higher reliability is a widely accepted engineering design technique and is used in this study to build resiliency and ensure power system stability in the presence of high levels of renewables. This paper presents a new design method for fault-tolerant wide-area damping controllers (WADCs) using modal-based control allocation (MB-CA), which coordinates a set of actuators to contribute to damping of inter-area oscillations. In our proposed method, when an actuator fails or is unavailable (e.g., due to communication failure), the supervisory MB-CA distributes the control signals to the remaining healthy actuators based on effects on the modal system, desired control actions, and actuator constraints. Our proposed block offers the benefits of modular design where it is independent of the nominal WADC. The proposed method consists of mainly two design steps. The first step is to design aWADC based on a fault-free model using robust control methods. The second step is to design an MB-CA to manage actuator availability and constraints. To validate the feasibility and demonstrate the design principles, a set of comprehensive case studies are conducted on a modified 192-bus Western Electricity Coordinating Council system. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in ensuring resiliency to different actuator failures and actuator availability.

Abstract: Wind farms and energy storage systems are playing increasingly more important roles in power systems, which makes their offering nonnegligible in some markets. From the perspective of wind farm-energy storage systems (WF-ESS), this paper proposes an integrated strategy of day-ahead offering and real-time operation policies to maximize their overall profit. As participants with large capacity in electricity markets can influence cleared prices by strategic offering, a large scaled WF-ESS is assumed to be a price maker in day-ahead markets. Correspondingly, the strategy considers influence of offering quantity on cleared dayahead prices, and adopts linear decision rules as the real-time control strategy. These allow enhancing overall profits from both dayahead and balancing markets. The integrated price-maker strategy is formulated as a stochastic programming problem, where uncertainty of wind power generation and balancing prices are taken into account in the form of scenario sets, permitting to reformulate the optimization problem as a linear program. Case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy by highlighting and quantifying benefits comparing with the price-taker strategy, and also show the profit enhancement brought to the distributed resources.

Title: Co-Optimization of Energy and Ancillary Services for Hydrothermal Operation Planning Under a General Security Criterion

Abstract: One of the most used methods for long-term hydrothermal operation planning is the stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). Using this method, the immediate and future water opportunity cost can be balanced and an economic-dispatch policy can be defined for multiple reservoirs under inflow uncertainty. In this framework, equipment outages and reserve deliverability are generally disregarded, despite their strong impact on the operative plan. However, recent advances in robust optimization have shown how to endogenously account for security criteria in scheduling models with reduced computational burden. Within this framework, reserve deliverability is ensured across the network via the co-optimization of energy and reserves (ancillary services). In this paper, we propose a new multistage model for planning hydrothermal coordination that co-optimizes the nominal energy dispatch and individual up and down reserve allocations. The main goal of this paper is to address a general n - K security criterion, such that, for each inflow scenario, the system is capable of withstanding the loss of up to K components, i.e., generation or transmission assets. The proposed methodology uses the column-and-constraint generation algorithm to efficiently incorporate a compound umbrella set of contingencies in the SDDP algorithm. Results for the Brazilian power system data corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Abstract: An expression of the compensation torque is derived to reduce the difference between the fifth-order generator model and the seventh-order model. It is appended to the swing equation in the fifth-order model, with the voltage equations and the flux linkage equations unchanged. Based on the singular perturbation theory, the stator transients are approximated. The fast current components of three rotor windings are represented by equivalent d- and q-axis stator current increments that create the same stator flux linkage. The relationship between this torque and damping is clarified from a physical viewpoint. Simulations on two systems show that the compensation torque reduces the model difference. The proposed damping preserving model overcomes the difficulty in determining the damping torque coefficient and is applicable to online transient stability analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) for damping of subsynchronous interaction (SSI) in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms. The proposed LQR controller employs a full-state observer to estimate all state variables. The output of the LQR is added to control signals of inner current control loops of DFIG converters as supplementary control signals. The supplementary control signals are dynamically limited to avoid saturating the converters and to provide the DFIG with the desired transient response against power system faults. The proposed SSI damping controller is designed for a realistic series compensated wind farm, and its performance is verified using electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations. The EMT simulations are performed using a detailed DFIG model which includes all nonlinearities and all required transient functions to meet the grid code requirements corresponding to fault-ride-through (FRT). The results show that the proposed SSI controller is able to significantly mitigate the oscillations due to the SSI phenomenon, and to provide excellent transient response against systems faults.

Abstract: This paper proposes a generic pole-to-pole short-circuit fault current calculation method for dc grids. The calculation procedure begins from the simplified RLC equivalent model of a single modular multilevel converter, and then the prefault matrices and faulted matrices are established and modified to calculate the dc fault currents of all the branches. The proposed approaches are validated by comparing with the electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation results on PSCAD/EMTDC. Besides, two case studies showed that the calculation method can be easily used to evaluate the severity of a dc fault. Moreover, the calculation can be applied to select the parameters of a fault current limiter (to match the circuit breaker capacity. The main contributions of the proposed numerical calculation method are: 1) The proposed method is accurate and much more time efficient than the EMT simulations; 2) the proposed method can handle all kinds of dc grid networks including the ring, radial, and meshed topologies; and 3) the proposed method is applicable to dc grid with multiple dc voltage level areas connected with dc/dc converters.

Abstract: This paper derives the index of dynamic interactions (IDI), which is the sensitivity of a power system electromechanical oscillation mode (EOM) of concern to the dynamic interactions introduced by a grid-connected double-fed induction generator (DFIG). Based on the IDI, analysis is carried out with the following generally-applicable conclusions obtained: 1) Impact of dynamic interactions introduced by the DFIG increases when wind power penetration increases; 2) as long as the frequency response of an equivalent single DFIG model approximately matches the frequency response of a wind farm around the frequency of electromechanical oscillations of concern, this equivalent dynamic model of single DFIG can be used to represent the wind farm to examine the impact of wind farm on EOMs. Furthermore, an indicator of DFIG control (IDC) is derived for comparing the impact of terminal voltage control and reactive power control implemented by the DFIG. Main merit of the IDC is the computational simplicity without need to know dynamic model of the DFIG to indicate that either the terminal voltage control or the reactive power control is more beneficial to power system stability. An example multimachine power system with grid-connected DFIGs is presented to demonstrate and validate the analysis and conclusions made in the paper.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast, standalone method for detecting multiple dual solutions (MDS) of the market dispatch problem. Using linear independence constraint qualification conditions and matrix theory, we characterize the conditions for MDS and develop a procedure for their detection. Our procedure exploits the structure of the market dispatch problem to improve computational efficiency. We demonstrate our method on eight nodal pricing scenarios, in four test systems.

Abstract: Hourly wind power ramps in ERCOT are studied by applying extreme value theory. Mean excess plot reveals that the tail behavior of large hourly wind power ramps indeed follows a generalized Pareto distribution. The location, shape, and scale parameters of generalized Pareto distribution are then determined by using mean excess plot and the least square technique, from which risk measures including aquantile value at risk and conditional value at risk are calculated.

Abstract: Inmany power system applications, such as N-x static security analysis and Monte-Carlo-simulation-based probabilistic power flow (PF) analysis, it is a very time-consuming task to analyze massive number of PFs on identical or similar network topology. This letter presents a novel GPU-accelerated batch LU-factorization solver that achieves higher level of parallelism and better memory-access efficiency through packaging massive number of LU-factorization tasks to formulate a new larger-scale problem. The proposed solver can achieve up to 76 times speedup when compared to KLU library and lays a critical foundation for massive-PFs-solving applications.

Abstract: This paper describes an integrated operational simulation tool that combines various stochastic unit commitment and economic dispatch models together that consider stochastic loads and variable generation at multiple operational timescales. The tool includes four distinct configurable sub-models within: dayahead lsecurity-constrained unit commitment (SCUC), real-time SCUC, real-time security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED), and automatic generation control (AGC). The unit commitment and dispatch sub-models within can be configured to meet multiple load and variable generation (VG) scenarios with configurable first stage and second-stage decisions determined where first-stage decisions are passed on and second-stage decisions are later determined by other sub-models in a continuous manner. The progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) is applied to solve the stochastic models to maintain the computational tractability of the proposed models. Comparative case studies, considering various configurations of stochastic and deterministic sub-models are conducted in low wind and high wind penetration scenarios to highlight the advantages of the stochastic programming during different decision-making processes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated with sensitivity tests using both economic and short-term reliability metrics to provide a broader view of its impact at different timescales and decision-making processes.

Abstract: Virtual inertia is known as an inevitable part of the modern power systems with high penetration of renewable energy. Recent trend of research is oriented in different methods of emulating the inertia to increase the sustainability of the system. In the case of dynamic performance of power systems especially in Automatic Generation Control (AGC) issue, there are concerns considering the matter of virtual inertia. This paper proposes an approach for analyzing the dynamic effects of virtual inertia in two-area AC/DC interconnected AGC power systems. Derivative control technique is used for higher level control application of inertia emulation. This method of inertia emulation is developed for two-area AGC system, which is connected by parallel AC/DC transmission systems. Based on the proposed technique, the dynamic effect of inertia emulated by storage devices for frequency and active power control are evaluated. The effects of frequency measurement delay and phase-locked loop effect are also considered by introducing a second-order function. Simulations performed by MATLAB software demonstrate how virtual inertia emulation can effectively improve the performance of the power system. A detailed eigenvalue analysis is also performed to support the positive effects of the proposed method.

Abstract: Anomalous data can negatively impact energy forecasting by causing model parameters to be incorrectly estimated. This paper presents two approaches for the detection and imputation of anomalies in time series data. Autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) and artificial neural network (ANN) models are used to extract the characteristics of time series. Anomalies are detected by performing hypothesis testing on the extrema of the residuals, and the anomalous data points are imputed using the ARX and ANN models. Because the anomalies affect the model coefficients, the data cleaning process is performed iteratively. The models are re-learned on "cleaner" data after an anomaly is imputed. The anomalous data are reimputed to each iteration using the updated ARX and ANN models. The ARX and ANN data cleaning models are evaluated on natural gas time series data. This paper demonstrates that the proposed approaches are able to identify and impute anomalous data points. Forecasting models learned on the unclean data and the cleaned data are tested on an uncleaned out-of-sample dataset. The forecasting model learned on the cleaned data outperforms the model learned on the unclean data with 1.67% improvement in the mean absolute percentage errors and a 32.8% improvement in the root mean squared error. Existing challenges include correctly identifying specific types of anomalies such as negative flows.

Abstract: In an electricity market, the main goal of a generation company (GenCo) is to maximize its profit, while encountering the uncertainty of the electricity price forecast. Different risk measures have been proposed to cope with this source of uncertainty. However, those are usually before-the-fact performance indices and cannot give a measure for the financial loss/gain (FLG) of a GenCo considering the electricity prices actually realized in the market. This paper focuses on this matter. The time series of FLG is first constructed given the real conditions of the electricity market. Then, the FLG time series is quantized using Silhouette criterion and k-means clustering approach. Subsequently, based on the historical values of the quantized FLG time series and relevant exogenous variables, its day-ahead values are predicted. The method proposed for day-ahead FLG prediction consist of conditional mutual information and sequential forward search as the feature selection technique and extreme learning machine as the forecasting engine. The effectiveness of the whole proposed approach, including the FLG time series construction, quantization approach, and the prediction method, is shown for a typicalGenCo using the real data of the PJM and Ontario electricity markets.

Abstract: An energy storage resource (ESR) has outstanding ramping capability, but its limited energy disables the provision of regulation service around the clock. As a comparison, a conventional generator (CG) is not restricted by the released energy, but the ramp rate is limited. In this paper, a method is proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of ESRs providing frequency regulation service in a single-area system. We measure the performance of frequency regulation by the standard deviation of system frequency excursions, and define the regulation requirement of an isolated power system as the minimum regulation capacity which satisfies the desired regulation performance. By analyzing the regulation requirements under different combinations of regulation resources, we can quantitatively compare the effectiveness of CGs and ESRs. Case studies show that ESRs can reduce regulation requirements, indicating that they are more effective than CGs in frequency regulation. However, they become less effective and even outperformed by CGs when they constitute a larger portion of the system regulation capacity.

Abstract: This paper presents a unit commitment algorithm that defines each unit discharge given the water head, the total plant downstream flow, the variable discharge upper limit, the unit efficiency curves, and the restricted operating zones in order to maximize power efficiency. This algorithm is part of the preprocessing phase that is intended to approximate a hydro-power production function that represents individualized unit decisions. A compact mixed-integer linear programming formulation, with fewer integer variables, based on an equivalent unit model and a piecewise linear generation function, is proposed. The unit commitment is integrated without increasing the model size and complexity due to the preprocessing phase. Moreover, the optimal aggregate decision is automatically converted to unit decisions by the proposed algorithm. The coordination with mid/long-term planning is performed by taking into account the power demand allocated to the hydro-power plants. Numerical tests on Brazilian hydro-power plants demonstrate that the proposed formulation has lower computational cost than unit individualized models considering a given accuracy level for the generation function approximation.

Abstract: This paper presents our study results on the correlated assignment of generation, load, or connection buses in a given grid topology and the development of an optimized search algorithm to improve the proposed synthetic grid model, called RT-nestedSmallWorld. A numerical measure, called "bus type entropy", was proposed in an initial study on this subject to characterize the correlation of bus type assignments in realistic grids. In this paper, its definition has been redefined and improved with the help of some newly obtained data of realistic grids so that the scaling property of a real-world grid's entropy value versus the network size can be effectively captured with a curve-fitting approach. With the help of the derived scaling function, we will be able to determine an appropriate target entropy value that a correlated bus type assignment should assume in a specific N-bus grid network. Therefore, our previously proposed synthetic power grid modeling has been enhanced with a direct search procedure for the best bus type assignments in a specific N-bus grid topology, saving the mandatory, but most of the time unattainable, requirement of a set of realistic grid data with a comparable network size for identifying the search target. Finally, the performance of the proposed approach is examined based on some available grid data including the IEEE test cases, the NYISO-2935, the ERCOT-5633, and the WECC-16994 systems.

Abstract: Conventionally, power system has a hierarchical control structure including primary, secondary, and tertiary controls. The drawbacks of this hierarchical scheme are manifest: 1) it lacks flexibility and scalability, which is against the trend toward an open-access power system; 2) load forecast as the basis of tertiary control could be inaccurate and infeasible, especially in microgrid for example; 3) as the penetration of renewable energy increases, the relatively long time-scales of secondary and tertiary controls cannot accommodate to more severe power fluctuation within the system. To avoid these drawbacks, a distributed real-time optimal power flow control strategy is introduced in this paper. With the aid of up-to-date smart grid technologies such as two-way communication and distributed sensor, the proposed approach can avoid the need of load forecast and achieve the same objective as hierarchical control with a feedback mechanism in real time, that is to recover the nominal system frequency and maintain the active power of the generators close to the optimal operational condition in the presence of any disturbance. Convergence of the proposed approach is analytically proved. Simulation results in a 34-bus islanded microgrid and the IEEE 118-bus bulk power grid validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel active power redispatch sequential approach to solve the transient stability-constrained optimal power flow (TSC-OPF) problem for the preventive control of transient stability. Based on an independent transient stability assessment of the power system for a given contingency scenario, two proposed power redispatch constraints are formulated and embedded into a conventional OPF formulation. Since these two new constraints only depend on steady-state variables, the dimension of the resulting TSC-OPF model is similar to that of a conventional OPF model and can be solved by standard optimization methods to perform a nonheuristic active power redispatch. The stabilization process is performed by sequentially solving the optimization and the transient stability problems until a suitable generation dispatch that provides a transiently stable equilibrium point is assessed. The validity and the effectiveness of the proposed method are numerically demonstrated in the WSCC three-machine, nine-bus system and an equivalent model of the Mexican power system.

Abstract: This paper focuses on distribution systems featuring renewable energy sources (RESs) and energy storage systems, and presents an AC optimal power flow (OPF) approach to optimize system-level performance objectives while coping with uncertainty in both RES generation and loads. The proposed method hinges on a chance-constrained AC OPF formulation, where probabilistic constraints are utilized to enforce voltage regulation with prescribed probability. A computationally more affordable convex reformulation is developed by resorting to suitable linear approximations of the AC power-flow equations as well as convex approximations of the chance constraints. The approximate chance constraints provide conservative bounds that hold for arbitrary distributions of the forecasting errors. An adaptive strategy is then obtained by embedding the proposed AC OPF task into a model predictive control framework. Finally, a distributed solver is developed to strategically distribute the solution of the optimization problems across utility and customers.

Abstract: Future power systems with high penetrations of variable renewables will require increased levels of flexibility from generation and demand-side sources in order to maintain secure and stable operation. One potential flexibility source is large-scale energy storage, which can provide a variety of ancillary services across multiple time scales. In order for appropriate levels of investment to take place, and in order for existing assets to be utilized optimally, it is essential that market signals are present which encourage suitable levels of flexibility, either from storage or alternative sources. Suboptimal storage plant dispatch due to uncertainty and inefficient market incentives are represented as operational constraints on the storage plant, and the impact of these inefficiencies are highlighted. Thus, changes required in operational practices for storage plant at different installed wind capacity levels, and the challenges that private storage plant operators will face in generating appropriate bids in a market environment at high variable renewable penetrations are explored. The impacts on system generating costs and storage profits are explored under different plant operating assumptions.

Abstract: Implementing automation system in distribution networks needs a huge investment that usually cannot be funded entirely in a short period of time. So distribution companies (DISCOs) should develop long-term plans to equip their network with automation technologies as far as economically justifiable. Aiming to provide a methodology for development such plans, this paper presents a novel multistage planning model for implementing distribution automation system considering all main hardware and software infrastructures. The proposed method optimally determines the type, location, and time in which an equipment or infrastructure must be added to network considering the network capacity expansion plan. The objective function of the planning problem is to maximize the net present value of the DISCO's profit in the planning time horizon. In this method, the optimization problem is solved using the genetic algorithm approach as a promising technique in solving the mixed integer nonlinear programming problems. The proposed method is evaluated on an illustrative test network and the obtained results are presented and discussed.

Abstract: Due to the significant improvements of power generation technologies and the trend of replacing traditional power plants with renewable generation resources, the generation portfolio will experience dramatic changes in the near future. The uncertainty and variability of renewable energy and their sitting call for strategic and economic plans for expanding the transmission capacities. In this study, we develop a data-driven two-stage stochastic transmission expansion planning with uncertainties. In the proposed approach, purely by learning from the historical data, we first construct a confidence set for the unknown distribution of the uncertain parameters. Then, we develop a two-stage data-driven transmission expansion framework, by considering the worst-case distribution within the constructed confidence set, so as to provide a reliable while economic transmission planning decision. Furthermore, to tackle the model complexity, we propose a decomposition framework embedded with Benders' and Column-and-Constraint generation methods. We implement our approach on 6-bus and 118-bus systems to test its effectiveness. Finally, we show as the amount of historical data grows, the conservativeness of the model decreases.

Abstract: It was usually considered in power systems that power flow equations had multiple solutions and all the eigenvalues of Jacobian matrix at the high-voltage operable solution should have negative real parts. Accordingly, type-1 low-voltage power flow solutions are defined in the case that the Jacobian matrix has only one positive real-part eigenvalue. However, an important issue that has not been well addressed yet is that the "negative reactance" may appear in the practical power system models. Thus, the negative real-part eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at the high-voltage operable solution may be positive and also the type-1 low-voltage solutions could have more than one positive real-part eigenvalues, being a major challenge. Therefore, in this paper, the recognition of the type-1 low-voltage power flow solutions is re-examined with the presence of negative reactance. Selected IEEE standard power system models and the real-world Polish power systems are then tested to verify the analysis. The results reveal that the negative reactance in the practical power systems has a significant impact on the negative real-part eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at the high-voltage operable solution as well as the number of positive real-part eigenvalues at the type-1 low-voltage power flow solutions.

Abstract: In this paper, three novel parameter identification methods are developed and used to solve the unknown parameters problem of integrated model of hydraulic turbine regulating system with uncertainties. The first and second methods are designed based on different parameter observers using dynamic system stability theorem, which are referred to as unknown parameter observer and synchronization-based parameter observer, respectively, while the third method is designed based on an ant lion optimizer (ALO) algorithm, which is referred to as the ALO-based estimator. Performance of the three methods are compared in various aspects, including the orders, the structure, and the independence of the identification system. Results show that the unknown parameter observer has the lowest identification system orders, while the synchronization-based parameter observer has the simplest system structure, and the ALO-based estimator owns the best system independence.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for the offering strategy of a virtual power plant that participates in the day-ahead and the real-time energy markets. The virtual power plant comprises a conventional power plant, a wind-power unit, a storage facility, and flexible demands, which participate in the day-ahead and the real-time markets as a single entity in order to optimize their energy resources. We model the uncertainty in the wind-power production and in the market prices using confidence bounds and scenarios, respectively, which allows us to formulate the strategic offering problem as a stochastic adaptive robust optimization model. Results of a case study are provided to show the applicability of the proposed approach.

Abstract: We present a method to design distributed generation and demand control schemes for primary frequency regulation in power networks that guarantee asymptotic stability and ensure fairness of allocation. We impose a passivity condition on net power supply variables and provide explicit steady-state conditions on a general class of generation and demand control dynamics that ensure convergence of solutions to equilibria that solve an appropriately constructed network optimization problem. We also show that the inclusion of controllable demand results in a drop in steady-state frequency deviations. We discuss how various classes of dynamics used in recent studies fit within our framework and show that this allows for less conservative stability and optimality conditions. We illustrate our results with simulations on the IEEE 68-bus transmission system and the IEEE 37-bus distribution system with static and dynamic demand response schemes.

Abstract: We consider the problem of distributed generation and demand control for primary frequency regulation in power networks, such that stability and optimality of the power allocation can be guaranteed. It was shown in Part I of this work, that by imposing an input strict passivity condition on the net supply dynamics at each bus, combined with a decentralized condition on their steady-state behavior, convergence to optimality can be guaranteed for broad classes of generation and demand control dynamics in a general network. In this paper, we show that by taking into account additional local information, the input strict passivity condition can be relaxed to less restrictive decentralized conditions. These conditions extend the classes of generation and load dynamics for which convergence to optimality can be guaranteed beyond the class of passive systems, thus, allowing to reduce the conservatism in the analysis and feedback design.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for real-time active network management (ANM) control to maximize network-wide energy yield in constrained networks. Coordinated scheduling of renewable distributed generation (DG) and distribution network control assets can limit DG curtailment and significantly increase energy yield and economic performance of DG. Here, an optimal power flow approach has been developed for real-time online scheduling of network control settings to better integrate high levels of temporally and spatially variable DG from renewable energy resources. Results show that the real-time prescription of ANM control settings provides a feasible alternative to network reinforcement under the existing passive management philosophy.

Abstract: Renewable generation and energy storage are playing an ever increasing role in power systems. Hence, there is a growing need for integrating these resources into the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. While storage devices are important for mitigating renewable variability, they introduce temporal coupling in the OPF constraints, resulting in a multiperiod OPF formulation. This paper explores a solution method for multiperiod AC OPF that combines a successive quadratic programming approach (AC-QP) with a second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation of the OPF problem. The SOCP relaxation's solution is used to initialize the AC-QP OPF algorithm. Additionally, the lower bound on the objective value obtained from the SOCP relaxation provides a measure of solution quality. This combined method is demonstrated on several test cases with up to 4259 nodes and a time horizon of eight time steps. A comparison of initialization schemes indicates that the SOCP-based approach offers improved convergence rate, execution time, and solution quality.

Abstract: This work revisits the semidefine programming (SDP) relaxation of the ac power flow equations in light of recent results illustrating the benefits of bounds propagation, valid inequalities, and the convex quadratic relaxation. By integrating all of these results into the SDP model a new hybrid relaxation is proposed, which combines the benefits from all of these recent works. This strengthened SDP formulation is evaluated on 71 AC Optimal Power Flow test cases from the NESTA archive and is shown to have an optimality gap of less than 1% on 63 cases. This new hybrid relaxation closes 50% of the open cases considered, leaving only eight for future investigation.

Abstract: In the future power system with high penetration of renewables, renewable energy is expected to undertake part of the responsibility for frequency regulation, just as the conventional generators. Wind power and battery storage are complementary in accuracy and durability when providing frequency regulation. Therefore, it would be profitable to combine wind power and battery storage as a physically connected entity or a virtual power plant to provide both energy and frequency regulation in the markets. This paper proposes a real-time cooperation scheme to exploit their complementary characteristics and an optimal bidding strategy for them in joint energy and regulation markets, considering battery cycle life. The proposed cooperation scheme is adopted in a real-time battery operating simulation and then incorporated into the optimal bidding model. The scheme could improve the wind regulation performance score and allow for more regulation bids without affecting the battery life, thus significantly increasing the overall revenue. The validity of the proposed scheme and strategy are proved by the case study.

Abstract: According to the feed-in tariff for encouraging local consumption of photovoltaic (PV) energy, the energy sharing among neighboring PV prosumers in the microgrid could be more economical than the independent operation of prosumers. For microgrids of peer-to-peer PV prosumers, an energy-sharing model with price-based demand response is proposed. First, a dynamical internal pricing model is formulated for the operation of energy-sharing zone, which is defined based on the supply and demand ratio (SDR) of shared PV energy. Moreover, considering the energy consumption flexibility of prosumers, an equivalent cost model is designed in terms of economic cost and users' willingness. As the internal prices are coupled with SDR in the microgrid, the algorithm and implementation method for solving the model is designed on a distributed iterative way. Finally, through a practical case study, the effectiveness of the method is verified in terms of saving PV prosumers' costs and improving the sharing of the PV energy.

Abstract: With the development of a new smart load device, the electric spring (ES), the operation of distribution systems with high renewable penetration becomes more flexible. The ESs can be installed at noncritical loads for grid support. This paper proposes a two-level voltage management scheme to optimize the voltage profiles of the network, especially at chosen critical buses. In the upper level, the tap positions of load tap changer and capacitor banks switching are optimized to prevent the voltages along the feeder from being out of limits. The model predictive control technique is applied to handle the uncertainties in renewable energy and demand. In the lower level, the responsibility of maintaining the voltages of the critical buses is shared among the ES in a distributed way via consensus control which is suitable for systems with limited communication and calculation capabilities. The proposed management scheme is verified on a modified IEEE 15-bus distribution network. The results show that different voltage regulation devices can work together to maintain the voltage of critical buses by sharing the responsibility in the proposed scheme.

Abstract: Multi-stage Adomian decomposition method (MADM) is a proven semi-analytical approximation solution technique for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which provides a rapidly convergent series by integrating over multiple time intervals. Applicability of MADM for large nonlinear differential algebraic systems (DAEs) is established for the first time in this paper using the partitioned solution approach. Detailed models of power system components are approximated using MADM models. MADM applicability is verified on 7 widely used test systems ranging from 10 generators, 39 buses to 4092 generators, 13659 buses. Impact of the step size and the number of terms is investigated on the stability and accuracy of the method. An average speed up of 42% and 26% is observed in the solution time of ODEs alone using the MADM when compared to the midpoint-trapezoidal (TrapZ) method and the modified-Euler (ME) method, respectively. MADM accuracy is found to be similar to the ME and comparable to the TrapZ method. MADM stability properties are found to be better than the ME and weaker than the TrapZ method. An average speed up of 13% and 5.85% is observed in the overall solution time using MADM w.r.t. TrapZ and ME methods, respectively.

Abstract: Linearized power flow models are of great interest in power system studies such as contingency analyses and reliability assessments, especially for large-scale systems. One of the most popular models-the classical DC power flow model-is widely used and praised for its state independence, robustness, and computational efficiency. Despite its advantages, however, the DC power flow model fails to consider reactive power or bus voltage magnitude. This paper closes this gap by proposing a decoupled linearized power flow (DLPF) model with respect to voltage magnitude and phase angle. The model is state independent but is distinguished by its high accuracy in voltage magnitude. Moreover, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of the DLPF model with the purpose of accelerating its computation speed, leading to the fast DLPF (FDLPF) model. The approximation that is applied to obtain the FDLPF model from the DLPF model is justified by a theoretical derivation and numerical tests. The proposed methods are provably accurate and robust for several cases, including radial distribution systems, meshed large-scale transmission systems and ill-conditioned systems. Finally, expressions for sensitivity with regard to MW flow and bus voltage are provided as a potential application.

Abstract: The performance of the Forward and Backward Extended Prony (FBEP) method on power system small-signal stability analysis is investigated in this paper. The effectiveness of the FBEP method in identifying system eigenvalues from the output signal is validated by experiments on a test system model. Using a four-machine-two-area power system model the estimation of the dominant modes contained in oscillatory signals given by the FBEP method is compared with that given by the SVD-TLS method, Trudnowski's algorithm, and the Prony with stepwise regression method. The multi-signal analysis and sliding window analysis using the FBEP method are also studied.

Abstract: Droop control has been extensively used by academia and industry for managing frequency fluctuations at microgrid (MG). This controller generates series of reference signals to different distributed energy sources (DES) such as diesel generator, PV, and wind system based on their respective maximum capacities. However, the combination of inertial and noninertial DES leads to frequency fluctuations at MG. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel frequency support strategy by controlling the operation of DES and controllable loads, i.e., electric vehicles (EVs). Moreover, fleet of EVs batteries maximum capacity depends upon constraints, such as state of charge (SoC), random arrival, and departure patterns. Hence, to accomodate EVs' batteries with droop controller, it has been enhanced with communication links and feedback mechanism and referred as modified droop controller (MDC). This MDC would be now able to dispatch reference signals to both DES and EVs. However, for meeting reference signal given to fleet of EVs, an aggregator (AG) is proposed. AG can alter the charging and discharging rates of EVs' thereby satisfying EVs' needs in terms of battery's SoC. Extensive simulations have been done using the proposed scheme on data available from Santa Rita Jails' MG.

Abstract: In this paper, we study unit commitment (UC) problems considering the uncertainty of load and wind power generation. UC problem is formulated as a chance-constrained two-stage stochastic programming problem where the chance constraint is used to restrict the probability of load imbalance. In addition to the conventional mixed integer linear programming formulation using Big-M, we present the bilinear mixed integer formulation of chance constraint, and then derive its linear counterpart using the McCormick linearization method. Then, we develop a bilinear variant of the Benders decomposition method, which is an easy-to-implement algorithm, to solve the resulting large-scale linear counterpart. Our results on typical IEEE systems demonstrate that (i) the bilinear mixed integer programming formulation is stronger than the conventional one and (ii) the proposed Benders decomposition algorithm is generally an order of magnitude faster than using a professional solver to directly compute both linear and bilinear chance-constrained UC models.
